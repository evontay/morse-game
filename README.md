# morse-game - WDI project 1B

This is a simple quiz game to help people learn Morse Code by practicing decoding it.

###Technology
The technology used include:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript 
- JQuery

###How it works

You will be provided with a Morse Chart that shows them how each letter/character sounds like using dot-dash or beeps. Take as long as you wish to memorise it.

When dot-dash game mode starts, each question containing a simple morse code will appear. When in Beeps mode, each question appears as a morse sound clip. You have to decode the morse code into English. 

If you need to refer back to the morse chart again, click HIDE/SHOW button to toggle open the chart. When chart is toggled open, timer will start counting down. You are only given 60 seconds of chart time for each game round. Use it wisely!
